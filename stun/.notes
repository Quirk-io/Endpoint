Problem:
If peer connects to rendez-vous server & listens on the port of connection, it will change each time it connects
Solution:
Set port from the first connection to rendez-vous server to lpeer port. And, always use it when you connect.


==== REGISTRATION ====
*Messages are always encrypted with pre-set AES_key when talking with rendezvous server

1. A connects to rendezvous server (S)
2. S registers A's public & private endpoint
- Public endpoint: Public Ip address, public source udp port
- Private endpoint: Private Ip address, private source udp port
- S gets private endpoint from the A
3. S sendes to A its endpoints
4. Keep-Alive
